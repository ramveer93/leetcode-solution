	 * https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/discuss/84290/Java-simple-easy-understand-solution-with-explanation
	 * 
	 * 
	 * For this problem, the main crux is that, we are dividing the task of adding 2
	 * numbers into two parts -
	 * 
	 * Let a = 13 and b = 10. Then we want to add them, a+b In binary, it would look
	 * as follows - a = 1 1 0 1 b = 1 0 1 0 -------------------- a+b = (1) 0 1 1 1
	 * Now we can break the addition into two parts, one is simple addition without
	 * taking care of carry, and other is taking the carry. With that strategy in
	 * mind, we have the following - simpleAddition(a, b): a = 1 1 0 1 b = 1 0 1 0
	 * -------------------- a+b = 0 1 1 1
	 * 
	 * carry(a, b): carry = 1 0 0 0 0 shift left by one, because we add the carry
	 * next left step :P Now if we can add the carry to our simpleAddition result,
	 * we can get our final answer. So add them using the simpleAddition method, and
	 * take care of the new carry again, unless carry becomes zero. This
	 * simpleAddition is performed by XOR ^operator, and the carry is performed by
	 * AND &operator. So our final answer would look as - (a^b) = 0 1 1 1 +carry = 1
	 * 0 0 0 0 ----------------------------- ans = 1 0 1 1 1
	 * ----------------------------- which is 23
