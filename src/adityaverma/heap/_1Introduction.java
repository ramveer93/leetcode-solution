	 * Identify: 1. k will be given
	 *           2. smallest/greatest will be asked
	 *           
	 *    When smallest,lowest,closest is asked ---> create max heap 
	 *    when greatest,largest,top is asked ----> create min heap
	 *    
	 *    time complexity: nlogk
	 *    
	 *    every heap question can be solved with sorting so in f2f 
	 *    interview first try with sorting and then explain why sorting taking 
	 *    too much time then move to heap
	 *    
	 *    Why sorting taking too much time: Beacuse in sorting we are 
	 *    exploring all elements but it should be just k elements
	 *
